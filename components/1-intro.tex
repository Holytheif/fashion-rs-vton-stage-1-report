\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Details of project work}
	This project comprises several interconnected components, each contributing to a seamless and immersive experience. Our work is has two main goals. One is to focus on the development of a recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering algorithms to provide personalized clothing recommendations by considering user preferences, past history, clothing item compatibility, and outfit possibilities. And the other is to develop an AR-integrated virtual try-on system to offer real-time interactivity with clothing items. Throughout the project, we have to keep user experience in mind and develop a robust feedback mechanism to continually improve the generated results.

\section{Objective}
	This project's primary objective is to develop an AI-based clothing recommender and an integrated AR virtual try-on system. It aims to provide users with personalized clothing suggestions and a realistic virtual try-on experience.

\section{Scope}
	The scope of this project is as follows:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Fashion embedding:} Fashion embedding is a pivotal component, serving as the foundation for further tasks.
		\item \textbf{Feature extractor:} Use deep learning to train a feature extractor which can segment parts of the upper body to provide user features for attribute-based recommendations, and to detect rendering regions for virtual try-on.
		\item \textbf{AI-based recommender:} Design and deploy a recommendation system that utilizes collaborative and content-based filtering to generate personalized clothing recommendations.
		\item \textbf{AR virtual try-on:} Develop an AR-based virtual try-on system that allows users to visualize and interact with clothing items in real-time.
	\end{enumerate}

\section{Motivation}
	Our motivations for this project are as follows:

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Reduce decision paralysis:} Online shoppers face an overwhelming array of clothing choices, often leading to hesitation and indecision. The abundance of options can make it challenging for users to make confident purchasing decisions, resulting in abandoned shopping carts and high return rates. Our primary motivation is to reduce this decision paralysis and make the process easier for the user by providing personalized recommendations.
		\item \textbf{Enhance online shopping experience:} The inability to try on garments before purchase has long been a pain point for consumers. Many potential buyers grapple with concerns about how garments will look on their bodies. This uncertainty can hinder their ability to make informed purchasing decisions and ultimately affect their overall satisfaction with the shopping process. We aim to enhance this experience with a real-time virtual try-on system.
		\item \textbf{Reduce environmental impact:} The issue of high return rates in e-commerce, particularly in the fashion sector, has far-reaching environmental consequences. Consumers often resort to ordering multiple sizes or styles of the same item, leading to excess packaging waste and unnecessary transportation emissions associated with product returns. We are motivated by the opportunity to reduce this environmental impact by offering a solution that minimizes the need for multiple orders and returns.
		\item \textbf{Adopt customer-centric approach:} A strong motivation for this project is a commitment to a customer-centric approach. We believe that every technological advancement and innovation should ultimately serve the needs and desires of consumers. The motivation is to create a solution that places users at the centre of the online shopping experience, giving them the tools and information they need to make choices that reflect their individuality and preferences.
		\item \textbf{Advance technological innovation:} The motivations for this project are aligned with the pursuit of technological innovation. We recognize that AI and AR are two of the most exciting and transformative technologies of our time. Their potential to reshape industries and improve people's lives is vast. Our motivation is to harness the power of these technologies and demonstrate their real-world applications in the e-commerce fashion sector.
