\metachapter{Abstract}

In an era where e-commerce has transformed the shopping landscape, the importance of personalized and engaging online experiences cannot be overstated. The purpose of this project is to address a pressing challenge in the fashion industry: helping online shoppers make informed and satisfying purchasing decisions. Traditional online shopping lacks the tactile experience of trying on clothes, which often leads to hesitation and returns. To bridge this gap, our project proposes to leverage artificial intelligence and augmented reality technologies to create a dynamic and immersive shopping experience.

An AI-based clothing recommendation system is supposed to understand individual preferences and style choices. It uses collaborative and content-based filtering, computer vision, deep learning, and natural language processing to analyze user interactions, historical behavior, and clothing attributes. The recommendation engine suggests clothing items tailored to the user's unique taste, enhancing the likelihood of finding the perfect garment.

An Augmented Reality virtual try-on system enables users to virtually try on recommended clothing items in real-time. By overlaying digital representations of clothing onto the user's image, the system provides a life-like preview of how the garments fit and look. Users can interact with the virtual try-on, adjust clothing elements, and evaluate the overall appearance before making a purchase decision.

Our project takes a holistic approach to online fashion retail. It not only aims to enhance user satisfaction but also aims to reduce the environmental and financial impact of clothing returns. By providing personalized recommendations and a virtual try-on experience, we hope for an increase in user confidence and a decline in return rates, which is a win-win scenario for both consumers and fashion retailers.
