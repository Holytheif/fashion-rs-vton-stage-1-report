\chapter{CONCLUSION}

In this preliminary project report, we discuss this project's core objective, which was to address the persistent challenges of decision paralysis and high return rates in fashion e-commerce. To this end, we designed an AI-driven clothing recommendation system that analyzes user preferences, behavior, and clothing attributes to offer personalized recommendations. This recommendation system serves as a compass, guiding users through the vast seas of fashion choices.

To enhance customer experience, an AR-based virtual try-on system which enables users to immerse themselves in the clothing items is proposed. This interactive experience has the power to bridge the tactile gap that online shopping has long suffered from, allowing users to virtually try on clothing and assess their fit and style in real-time. It offers a dynamic shopping experience that empowers users to make informed purchasing decisions.

The project is not only about enhancing user experiences but also about promoting sustainability. By reducing return rates and aligning with eco-friendly practices, we aspire to contribute to a more environmentally responsible fashion industry.
